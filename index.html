				<p>This article is part of the Beginner Web Developer Series. The series is targeted to people who’d like to start serious web development, as well as people who are already web developers and want to solidify their knowledge of fundamentals while possibly filling in some holes. If you find yourself tinkering with HTML, CSS, or Javascript until you sort of get it to work, this series is for you. The material in this series is closely tied to my top-rated Coursera course.
